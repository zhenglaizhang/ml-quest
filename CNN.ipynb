    "- A **perceptron** is a single neuron model that was a precursor to larger neural networks.\n",
    "- Mathematically, neural networks are capable of learning any mapping function and have been proven to be a universal approximation algorithm.\n",
    "- The data structure can pick out (learn to represent) features at different scales or resolutions and combine them into higher-order features\n",
